Need a way to settle an argument between a native English speaker and a native Spanish speaker? Here is the solution. Paper, scissors, rock but a new and improved bi-lingual version. You have the ability to choose a single game, best of three or best of five game to settle your argument. All you need to do is follow these simple instructions:

====

1. Load the game file onto both boards using 'make program' in terminal
2. You will be greeted with choosing language screen. Using navswitch up and down, choose between English or Spanish, and push the navswitch down to select. (This can be player dependent.)
3. To begin the game, press the navswitch down. 
4. Using the navswitch up and down, toggle between the number of games to select how many games you would like to play best of, (Ensure both players agree on how many games!). Press the button to select this value.
5. Use the up and down on the navswitch to choose your character, paper, scissors or rock. (This can be done without other board nearby for secrecy). Click the button to confirm your choice.
6. When both players have completed the prior steps and have the "CLICK TO SEND" scrolling on screen, bring boards near each other, and click the button once to send (Make sure boards are together with IR send/recievers facing each other). Once clicked your board will say "WAITING" until your opponent presses theirs.
7. If you both select the same, this is a draw, and you will be taken back to select character. Else, you will be shown a smiley face or a sad face depending on who won that round. Click the button to continue.
8. If screen goes back to select character, repeat steps 5-8. Else, a winning or losing screen will be shown. Click the button to continue, and restart the game from step 3.
